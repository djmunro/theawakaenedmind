Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal. Any man working towards a predetermined goal is a success, if not a failure

The only person who succeeds is the person is progressively realizing an idea. The person who says I'm going to do this and then works towards that goal.

## The key to success is having goals

Why do some men succeed in other men fail. It's because we become what we think about.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson said:
> A man is what he thinks about all day long

William James said:
> The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes.

and...

> We need only in cold blood ACT as if the thing in question were real, and keep acting as if it were real, and it will infallibly end by growing into such a connection with our life that it will become real.

Even our great savior endorsed success. And Jesus said to him, *"All things are possible for one who believes."*. So all we have to do is choose a clearly defined goal, think about it often, and it will be added to us.

Or as Vincent Norman Peale put it
>"If you think in negative terms, you will get negative results. If you think in positive terms, you will achieve positive results"

George Bernard Shaw put it this way
> People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.

Plant your goal in your mind, it will be the greatest decision you'll ever make in life. Whatever it is you want to do plant that seed in your mind. Thank about it, work steadily towards it, Care for it, and it will become a reality.


## The 30 day test
The results of the 30 days will be in exact proportion of the effort you put into it

First think about the following before beginning the 30 day test.

### We must control our thoughts to control our lives:
1. As he so shall you reap. We literally become what we think about.
2. Cutting away all factors of the mind and you're allowing it to soar, and realizing your limitations are self imposed.
3. Using all your courage, think positively on your problem. Plan and set a clearly defined goal.
4. Save at least 10% of every dollar you earn, and realizing even your present job is enormous opportunities.


### And the price we have to pay is:
1. you will become what you think about
2. Remember the word imagination and let your mind sore
3. Kurdish concentrate on your goal every day
4. Save 10% of what you earn 
5. Action. Ideas are worthless unless you act on them


### Outline of the 30 day test

1. Write on a card what it is that you want more than anything else. Look at it every morning and every night, be cheerful as you read and think about your goal.

2. As you look at it remember you become what you think about, and since you're thinking about it you will become what you wrote down.

3. The goal is actually yours as soon as you write it down and think about it.

On one side of the card write your goal whatever it may be. On the other side right ask and it shall be given to you. Seek and you shall find and knock and it will be opened unto you


### Now the difficult part

1. stop thinking about what it is you fear. Every time a negative thought comes and replace it with a positive thought about your worthwhile goal

2. Each day do you more than you have to do

3. Give of yourself more than you have ever done before. Do this knowing that your returns and life are in direct proportion to what you give


At the immediate time you decide to work on a goal you become a success. Don't worry about how you were going to achieve your goal. Leave that to a higher power. Just know where you are going, The answers will come to you on their own accord. 

__Say these words time and time again over the next 30 days__

> Ask and it shall be given to you

> Seek and you shall find

> Knock and it shall be opened unto you

All you need is purpose and faith. Don't start your test until you've made up your mind to stick with it

*If you should fail within the 30 day*. By that I mean if you find yourself overwhelmed by negative thoughts you have to start over again from that point and go 30 more days

#### Don't forget the card because it's vitally important to this new way of living

#### Above all don't worry. Worrying brings fear and fear is crippling

Know that all you have to do is hold your goal before you. Everything else will take care of itself. Remember that you reap what you sow. So if you so negative thoughts, your life will be filled with negative things. If you so positive thoughts your life will be cheerful and positive

Also remember. Success is not the result of making money. Making money is a result of success. No man can get rich himself without enriching others.


### Other steps for success:
1. set yourself a definite goal
2. Quit running yourself down 
3. Stop thinking of all the reasons you can't be successful and start thinking for the reasons you can
4. Trace your attitude bacteria childhood where you first got the idea that you couldn't be successful if that's what you're thinking
5. Change the image of yourself by writing a description of the person you would like to be
6. Act the part of the person you would like to become

Make a 30 day test and repeated and repeated again
