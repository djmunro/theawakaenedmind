In the year 1843, a group of boys came to Dr. Russell Herman Conwell's church and asked him, if he would be willing to instruct them in college courses. They wanted a college education, but lacked the money to pay for it. He told the boys he would do all he could. As the boys left, he had a thought; an idea began to form, he said, "why couldn't there be a fine college for poor, deserving young men". Almost single-handily Dr. Conwell raised almost 7 million dollars which he founded one of the worlds leading universities. He did this by doing more than 6000 lectures all over the country, and in each one of them, he told the story called "acres of diamonds".

The story was an account of an African farmer who heard tales of about other settlers who made millions discovering diamond mines. These tales so excited the farmer that he could hardly wait to sell his farm and search for diamonds himself.

Therefore, he sold his farm, and spent the rest of his life wandering the valleys of the vast African continent searching unsuccessfully for the gleaming gems, which brought such high markets prices of the world.

Finally, in a fit of despondency, broke and desperate, he threw himself into a river and drowned. Meanwhile the man who had bought his farm one day found a large and unusual stone in a stream, which cut-through the property and the stone turned out to be a great diamond, with enormous value, the farm was then discovered covered with them and it was to become one of the richest diamond mines. The first farmer had literally owned acres of diamonds, but it sold him for practically nothing, so he could look for them elsewhere.

If he had only taken the time to study and prepare himself, to learn what diamonds look like in their rough state and at first thoroughly explore the land he owned, he would have found the millions he sought right on his own land.

The profound thing about this story that affected Dr. Conwell and subsequently millions of others was that the idea, each of us, at this moment **Standing in the middle of your own acres of diamonds**. If we only would have the wisdom and patience to intelligently and effectively explore the work in which now we are engaged, we usually would find the riches in which we seek.

There is nothing more pitiful in my mind then person running from one-thing-to-another, forever looking for the pot-of-gold at the end of the rainbow, and never staying with one thing long enough to find it.

No matter what your goal may be, perhaps the road to it can be found in the very thing in which you are now engaged.

In the next post, we will dive into techniques and ways to find our acres of diamonds in our vocations through ideas and using our most expensive asset!
