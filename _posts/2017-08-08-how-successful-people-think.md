In this article, you will learn how successful people think. You will learn a exercise that will allow you to transform your life. A plan you can follow that takes little time each day, one hour a day, 5 times a week.

> It is clear that persons who live close to their capacity, who continue to activate their potential, have a pronounced sense of well-being  and considerable energy. They see themselves as lesding purposeful and creative lives.
> -Herbert Ottto

Lets look at a few facts. The average working person has athis disposal an enormous amount of free time, in fact if you total the amount of hours in a year and subtract the sleeping hours (if he sleeps 8 hours every night). You'll find he has almost (in hours)

* Waking hours = 6000
* Working hours = 2000
* Discretionary hours = 4000

Average working man has 4000 hours a year where he is neither working nor sleeping.

In those 4000 hours our mind is free.

Take one hour a day five days a week and exercise your mind

### Take a blank sheet of paper
1. write your primary goal at the top
2. Right as many ideas as you can for improving that which you do now
3. Think of 20 possible ways for improvement


**Remember the following two points**
1. it's not easy
2. most of your ideas will not particularly be any good

When I say it's not easy it's like forming a new habit. At first you'll find it difficult to come up with 20 ideas, and change your  familiar ways. But it is worth it

**The most important thing the test will do will deeply embedded your goal into your mind.**

So...
* 20 ideas a day = 100 ideas a week
* 1 hour a day X 5 days = 260 hours a year
* Free leisure time = 3740 hours

You'll be thinking of your goal and how to improve your current position a full 6 1/2 working weeks a year. 6 1/2 four weeks of thinking and planning. See how easy it is to rise above the so-called competition

This will still leave you 15 hours a day to do as you please

Soon you will find that your mind will be working all day long. End it odd moments good ideas will be popping into your head. *Write them down as soon as you can*.

**Just one good idea can completely revolutionize your work and your life.**

If you want to develop the muscles of your body you need to take an exercise of some sort. The mind works in the same way.

***Is it worth it.*** It's like spending five hours a week digging in the mind of gold. Each time you write your goal at the top of the sheet don't worry about it or be concerned about it. Think about it only a problem to be solved in a goal to be reached. Face it with faith. And then the powers of all your mind to solving it. And believe me solve it you will.

# Recap
1. Spend one hour a day generating as many ideas as you can - to improve what you are doing now. Try for **20 ideas a day.**
2. Enhance your life - try to increase your mental abilities at least 20% or more (remember average person uses ~5-6%).
3. *Successful people are not people without problems* - they have **learned** to **solve** their problems
4. Don't waste time and money worrying about needless things
5. Use your mind effectively to achieve your goals.

40% of them will never happen, 30% have already happened and can't be changed. 12% our needless worries about our health. 10% are petty miscellaneous worries.

Only 8% are real. Try to separate The real from the unnecessary. And solve those which are in your ability to solve.

Last of all the only thing I can take you to your goal is your mind
