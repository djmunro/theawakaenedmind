In the last segment of Acres of diamonds (Read [Acres Of Diamonds - Part 1: You Already Own the Acre Of Diamonds]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-31-acres-of-diamonds %}) if you have not already done so) we read the story of "Acres of Diamonds" and learned that each one of us, have enumerable opportunities awaiting us in our current places of employment. One of the worst things we can do is, to perceive that the grass is greener elsewhere, and jump from our current job to another in pursuit of a better job, more room for growth, and “a better team”. Instead, let us focus on what is available to us, and MAKE opportunities.

A farmer once poked a pumpkin into the hole of a jug. The pumpkin began to grow and eventually could not grow anymore. When the farmer broke the glass, he had a pumpkin exactly the same size and shape, as was the jar. If we are not careful, each of us can do a similar thing of mistakenly poking ourselves into jugs. It is up to us to poke the jug. Not the job. Not the economy. We do it. 

People, who see their work as an opportunity for growth and development, are the people who succeed. The key to success is preparation. If we become so good what we do we will force the opportunity into the jobs that we have. 

It takes creative imagination to realize that diamonds do not look like diamonds in their rough state. 

> "Great opportunities lurk in every aspect of our work in which do" -Earl Nightingale

It is up to us to recognize and Prospect those diamonds. 

In order to begin prospecting the diamonds in our vocation, first begin by developing **intelligent objectivity**. Which really just means developing the ability to look at your job as a stranger would. A stranger who sees your job as an opportunity, a pasture that is much greener than his own.

We can begin to do this by the following steps...

Starting at the beginning. Within the framework of what industry or what profession does your job fall under.

## Become a student of your industry

Ask yourself the following questions
* Do you know everything you can know about your industry? How did it begin? Why did it begin who started it and when?

* What is your industries dollar volume? How fast has it grown in the last 20 years? What is the projected growth during the next 10 years?

**Become an expert in your field**. You can do this in less than five years, and experts are the ones to write their own tickets in life.

We should know as much about our job is a good doctor or a good lawyer knows about his or her own. This is what it means to be a professional.

To become a professional we must learn and study the following subjects

1. Study your company and its industry

2. Our job and our next step in our career

3. Study people. Since getting along with people determines our range of our growth, we must learn how to deal with people.

Investing in becoming a professional *will* pay off in huge dividends. 

## We can further try to mine our acres of diamonds by thinking of ways we can increase our contribution to our company and our industry, and those whom we serve.

The minute you adopt this type of attitude you immediately become part of the top 5% of the world. You are affecting life rather than being affected by it. 

Also by changing your mental attitude takes care of two vitally important parts for successful living.

1. First you will find yourself becoming more interested and enthusiastic about your work and its future, and both interest in enthusiasm is contagious.

2. You are building financial security, which will last a lifetime.

So keep this thought in your mind as often as possible on and off the job.

> "Somewhere in your present work there lurks an opportunity which will bring you everything you could possibly want for yourself and your family. It will not be labeled opportunity. It will be hidden in common everyday garments. Like the dirty drinking cup which started the paper cup industry"

In closing, meditate and remember the following 12 points

1. Explore the work you are currently engaged in. You will find the riches, tangible or non-tangible you wish to have.
2. Realize that your own pasture is green - and unlimited.

3. The way you go about your job makes it bad or good. There is no such thing as a bad job.

4. Let yourself grow - avoid self-limitation like the pumpkin in the jug.

5. Start preparing yourself for opportunity - now. That way we are ready to take advantage of the opportunities in our future, the opportunities around us now.

6. Put your imagination to work on ways of improving what you are now doing.

7. Learn all that you can about your job, your company, and your industry.

8. There is no limit to your growth potential. It follows similarly that since there is no limit to the growth of your industry, that there is no limit of your growth.

9. Our economy needs and will reward the uncommon person who participates in its growth.

10. Begin to build your library of reference material on your company, industry, your job, and people skills
11. Set aside an hour a day for study and research.

12. Remember the story of the Acres of Diamonds.
